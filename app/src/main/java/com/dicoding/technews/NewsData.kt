        "PT Xurya Daya Indonesia (Xurya), a solar power rental and installation start-up, received an additional Series A funding from global trading and investment company Mitsui & Co (Mitsui) and PT Surya Semesta Internusa Tbk (SSIA).\\n\\nThe move follows a US\$21.5 million received in initial Series A funds from East Ventures Saratoga, Schneider Electric and New Energy Nexus in December 2021.\\n\\n**Read also: [Solar start-up Xurya bags \$21.5m in series A funding](https://www.thejakartapost.com/business/2022/01/12/solar-start-up-xurya-bags-21-5m-in-series-a-funding.html)**\\n\\nIt brings the total funds obtained in Series A to \$33 million, the start-up announced in a press release on Monday.\\n\\n\\\"The funding will be allocated to support the expansion of solar power development to accelerate the clean and sustainable energy transition for companies in Indonesia,” Xurya managing director and co-founder Eka Himawan was quoted as saying in the release.\\n\\nXurya plans to use part of the funds for technological developments and additional staff.\\n\\nEka added that their participation was also a way for Mitsui and Surya Semesta Internusa to reach out to potential customers in Indonesia.\\n\\nThe government has announced a target to lift the share of new and renewable energy in the country’s energy mix to 23 percent by 2025.\\n\\nRooftop solar power is still in its infancy in Indonesia with an insignificant but quickly growing contribution to overall electricity generation. According to the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, a total of 70 megawatts in on-grid solar rooftop capacity was installed as of September this year.\\n\\n**Read also: [Rooftop solar panels, are they worth it?](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2021/08/20/rooftop-solar-panels-are-they-worth-it.html)**\\n\\nXurya, which was founded in 2018, said its business was growing rapidly and it now operated rooftop systems in more than 60 companies.

        "Sustainability has become a hot topic, not only for government policymakers but for corporate leaders as well. In the coming years, sustainability issues will play a huge role in defining corporate agendas and could recalibrate the relationship between business and society. These developments are welcome, and corporate leadership is needed now more than ever.\\n\\nHowever, the walk has not always followed the talk. Only 37 percent of companies have aligned sustainability objectives with their business strategies; only 33 percent have integrated sustainability objectives and metrics into business processes; and only 40 percent have identified initiatives to close their sustainability gaps for change.\\n\\nThese statistics come from a recent IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) and Oxford Economics study that polled 1,958 executives in 32 countries to map their sustainability readiness.\\n\\n“Lots of talk is happening, but not enough action,” the study reported. “While 86 percent of companies have a sustainability strategy, only 35 percent have taken action on that strategy.”\\n\\nFewer than 50 percent of the business leaders surveyed said they were willing to change existing business practices at the expense of profits to improve sustainability. And only 27 percent viewed sustainability as a core element of their business value.\\n\\n“These findings highlight the immense sustainability challenge companies face in converting their intentions and pledges into reality,” the IBV report stated. “Achieving change at scale requires a fundamental reconfiguration of how value is created. And businesses need to lead—rather than follow.”\\n\\n**Indonesia’s green plan**\\n\\nIndonesia has committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The National Development Planning Ministry developed an SDG road map to identify the challenges, policy strategies and progress indicators for each SDG.\\n\\nThe government also developed a series of initiatives to achieve the SDGs, such as promoting mangrove rehabilitation to slow deforestation and continuing the mobilization of climate finance and innovative financing, such as hybrid financing, green bonds and green _sukuk_ (Islamic bonds). The energy sector includes electric vehicle ecosystem development; the construction of Southeast Asia’s largest solar power plant; and the use of new and renewable energy, including biofuel.\\n\\nDigital transformation, sustainable investment and policy reform will catalyze progress toward development goals, strengthen the country’s ESG ecosystem and ultimately create shared value for all.\\n\\nTechnology has an important part to play in helping government agencies and businesses meet sustainability goals. Currently, the ICT sector is responsible for between 1.8 and 3.9 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and data centers account for 3 percent of annual total energy consumption. Any advances in data center tech will mean huge benefits.\\n\\nThat’s where a unique server from IBM, with green computing at its core, comes in. Called LinuxONE, it reduces energy consumption by a whopping 75 percent, the carbon dioxide footprint by 850 metric tonnes annually and requires 50 percent less data center space compared to similar industry-grade servers.\\n\\nIt also features quantum-safe security algorithms and meets security requirements for sensitive workloads, including those in regulated industries such as financial services. The LinuxONE Emperor 4 server protects data in use while providing end-to-end encryption for data at rest and data in flight. This provides businesses with a solid data and cybersecurity strategy.\\n\\n**Remarkable results**\\n\\nAre there any early adopters? Here are a few who have achieved remarkable results with LinuxONE:\\n\\nThe bottom line: Today’s hybrid and multi-cloud environments require clients to deploy workloads where it makes the most sense for their business needs.\\n\\n“[IBM’s Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-virtual-servers) provide a public cloud environment in which the cloud tenant retains complete authority over virtual servers for workloads that contain sensitive data.\\n\\n“Built on LinuxONE and running on the [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud), this service provides customers authority over their data, workloads and encryption keys with privacy and cybersecurity.”\\n\\n_The author is general manager and technology leader at IBM ASEANZK (Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Southeast Asia)._\\n\\n_This article is published in collaboration with IBM.",
        "Many believe that conventional banks will eventually catch up to financial technology (fintech) platforms and digital banks in terms of retail banking competitiveness, but industry players hinted that collaboration with them might be the key to success as it can be more efficient.\\n\\nBank HSBC Indonesia IT director and chief operating officer James Rex Elwes said on Oct. 5 that retail banking has the fastest transformation, so fast that several conventional banks are failing to offer the same convenience to customers as fintech and digital banks did, hence the need for interaction.\\n\\n“The ability for customers to report their payment data and shift seamlessly from one bank to another, from one financial institution to another, it's definitely the future. I think that will have huge implications. I think it has massive customer satisfaction and massive customer experience benefits,” said Elwes.\\n\\n“I think it brings opportunities to banks and financial institutions, but I think those can only be unlocked if we improve the way we collaborate across banks and financial and non-financial institutions,” he added.\\n\\nSpeaking on the same stage with Elwes at the World Financial Innovation Series on Oct. 5, Amar Bank chief technology officer Kevin Kane said that collaboration with digital industry players is just as important as those between banks and to emphasize his point, he raised the case of time relevance.\\n\\n“I think some of the banks just don't want to lose on the timing. They just follow but they don't exactly know what kind of product they should offer their customers. \\\\[Digitization\\\\] requires 1-two years of development, and by \\\\[the time they finished the development\\\\] they already lost the momentum. That's where the fintech players are better than conventional banks,” Kevin said.\\n\\n“When these fintech \\\\[firms\\\\] come into the picture, implementing new things and new features, they don't need two years of development. They only need three months in technical terms, two to three spins and it goes to production,” he added.\\n\\nIncorporating integration techniques, such as using application programming interface (API), a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention will not change a lot of the legacy architecture of existing banks, explained Elwes.\\n\\n“I think there could be more opportunity and more steps can be taken to open up some of that architecture, \\\\[…\\\\] that can make it easier to collaborate with fintechs and I think that is where the opportunity is,” said Elwes.\\n\\nRitesh Varma, VP of business consulting of Newgen, an Indian company that provides unified digital transformation platform, said on Oct. 5 that these legacies are lagging the process of digitization. He also said that the spread conventional banks have will always give them the upper hand vis-à-vis digital banks and fintechs.\\n\\n“Conventional banks specialize in corporate banking as well. They carry a lot of customers already with them and the branch network is huge. So, if they want, they can be much more competitive or give the digital banks a run for their money because of the spread that they have,” Varma said.\\n\\n“The existing branch network, which is there in each and every corner of Indonesia of conventional banks, will come in really handy. It's about standardization of experiences across a mobile device, a branch work or a portal which will help you make things happen and I think that's where conventional banks have a merit,” he continued.\\n\\n“I think banks have invested in a lot of things. So, the most challenging part is how to make these silos collaborate with each other and make them work. \\\\[…\\\\] The challenge is all in the mind I think, but it will work out,” he added.\\n\\nDeepti Mittimani, vice president (VP) of product & business development of M2P, an Indian technology and software provider company, told _The Jakarta Post_ on Oct. 4 that conventional banks have far bigger base than fintechs.\\n\\nUltimately, she continued, users and customers always trust big banks, although admitting that there has always been a phase where fintechs seem bigger, but eventually the big banks will provide better services. \\n\\nStarting from IDR 55,500/month\\n\\nOr let Google manage your subscription",
        "An Indonesian start-up working with the government in a waste management program says it needs more trash to scale-up operations and eventually process recyclables in the country rather than exporting them.\\n\\nThe Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry has enlisted Indonesian start-up, SMEsHub, for its waste management program, focusing specifically on litter produced by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).\\n\\nSMEsHub founder and CEO Lutpi Ginanjar said the start-up’s first export deal within the program was inked with a Malaysian company.\\n\\n“In July this year, a Malaysian company asked us to export an initial 50 tonnes of waste. They then found that our waste is of high quality, so the export contract was bumped up to 4,000 tonnes per month,” Lutpi said.\\n\\nPrior to working with the ministry, the start-up consulted MSMEs on business operations.\\n\\nThe increase in waste exports prompted Lutpi to approach the ministry in the hope of getting hold of more trash, such as plastic bottles and clothes hangers.\\n\\n“We have a legal standing with the buyer that once we have a long-term contract, we want them to invest here and build a waste management facility so that we can export the end products,” Lutpi said, expressing his plan for downstream waste processing.\\n\\nThe program was born out of environmental concern after he had witnessed the amount of plastic waste produced by MSMEs, Lupti said, adding that he hoped the deal with the ministry could help MSMEs with waste management in the future.\\n\\nThe scope of the cooperation covers the exchange and utilization of information, support with waste management in tourist destinations and coordination with other stakeholders in waste management.\\n\\nTourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno noted that there was no comprehensive solution to the issue of waste yet and added that this plastic waste management program could convert waste into exportable products.\\n\\n“The government has set a national target to reduce waste by 30 percent and increase waste management or waste handling by 70 percent by 2025,” Sandiaga said.\\n\\nApart from contributing to the national target, Sandiaga said the collaboration with SMEsHub could create jobs.\\n\\nThe cooperation is manifested in a memorandum of understanding signed by tourist destinations and infrastructure undersecretary Vinsensius Jemadu, digital economy and creative product undersecretary M. Neil El Himam and Lutpi as the representative of SMEsHub.",
        "Bank DBS Indonesia issued a short-term loan worth Rp 500 billion (US\$32.7 million) to aquaculture start-up eFishery, as announced in a signing ceremony held on Friday.\\n\\n“We are happy to give a capital loan for eFishery who is very visionary in using technology to modernize the aquaculture sector of fish and shrimps,” said Bank DBS Indonesia director of institutional banking-group Kunardy Lie in a statement. \\n\\nFocusing on cultivation of fish and shrimps with technology since its founding in 2013, eFishery CEO Gibran Huzaifah said he is grateful for this loan, thanks to tech-industry development, remembering how borrowing money from the bank for this kind of business used to be impossible.\\n\\n“Back to our third year, our business nearly died because no bank was willing to give a loan for even a mere Rp 50 million. However, now DBS has entrusted us with a loan of Rp 500 billion,” Gibran said.\\n\\nNonetheless, this bank loan funding option can be viewed as anti-mainstream, considering how most start-ups receive their capital injection from venture capitalists.\\n\\n“Why did we choose bank loans instead of funding from venture capital? Because it’s cheaper. \\\\[…\\\\] We have to pay a huge amount for VC later on in the form of share-owning. When you do the calculations, a bank loan is much cheaper,” said Gibran.\\n\\n“Lending from banks is how big corporations operate and that allows them to be big,” he added.\\n\\neFishery currently controls the ecosystem of about 80,000 fish and shrimp farmers with 280,000 ponds under their belt. Gibran said the company could grow that big by virtue of how untapped the sector is.\\n\\n“\\\\[Aquaculture\\\\] is not a very competitive sector. We don’t have to grapple for market share while the market \\\\[potential\\\\] is massive. But we have only touched 4 percent of farmers,” said Gibran, pointing out how unexplored the aquaculture market is.\\n\\nData from the Food and Agriculture Organization showed that aquaculture has a compound annual growth rate of 18.7 percent, making it one of the sectors with the most rapid growth within the past 40 years.\\n\\n“We hope this loan can accelerate the eFishery business expansion and improve the quality of fish and shrimp farmers, as well as creating sustainable food security,” said Kunardy.\\n\\n“Bank DBS Indonesia’s commitment to partner with eFishery is one of our focuses to stimulate growth in the Indonesian digital economy industry as well as a display of our seriousness in governing businesses in accordance with environmental, social and governance \\\\[principles\\\\],” he added.",
        "The increasingly popular adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), big data and Internet of Things (IoT) globally in recent times has affected the demand for chip computing and talented semiconductor workers.\\n\\nTaiwan, a powerhouse in the semiconductor industry, occupies a crucial role in the global supply chain thanks to its own sophisticated semiconductor industry chain and resources. Its closely integrated semiconductor upstream and downstream industries have allowed Taiwan to enjoy a high market share in semiconductor design, manufacturing and packaging.\\n\\nFrom 2020 to 2021, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry grew year-on-year by 26.7 percent from US\$100.5 billion to \$134.5 billion, making it the second largest worldwide in terms of output value.\\n\\nReflecting its status as a global powerhouse, the Taiwanese government is actively building Taiwan into a semiconductor advanced process center and high-end manufacturing center in Asia.
